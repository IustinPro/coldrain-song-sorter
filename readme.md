# Coldrain Sorter

A fork of Sakura Gakuin Sorter.

Steps to Use:
Simply open the linked website
https://iustinpro.github.io/coldrain-song-sorter/

For Mobile use please use desktop mode, formating in mobile is a bit funny at the moment!
Fair Warning this sorter has 100+ songs and needs 400+ battles (if not more), this will take a very long time!

I am aware that the click to start button does not work, to start click on the left or right logo.
